This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# reactPortfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project is to provide a personal portfolio app for future employers to access.

## User Story

```
As a bootcamp graduate

I want to display my portfolio to future employers

So I can obtain as many job opportunities as possible

```

## How It Works

1. From your CLI create a react app using `create-react-app`
1. From your newly created app run the following commands separately to install dependencies: `npm install jquery --save` and `npm install react-ga --save`
1. Next download my repo or visit the original repo [here](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template).
1. Replace the `src` folder and the `public` folder in your react app with the folders you downloaded from GitHub.
1. Update the information in `public > resumeData.json`
1. Remember to replace the images with your own, for ease of use KEEP THE FILE NAMES THE SAME.
